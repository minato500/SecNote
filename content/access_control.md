# Access Control

It is also known as Authorization, mean what you are able to do. Authentication is providing our identity, like when we check into our hotel, Authorization or access control is what we are allowed to do. Example once we have checked into our hotel and we have completed our authorization, we get a card key or like a room key, and this key might give us access to our room, the elevator, the restaurant, the pool, the gym, etc.

## Types of Access Control

1. Vertical access control would check if a user has privileges to access administrative functionality, and this is probably the easiest to grasp. So, we have different users or different levels of access, and they are given to different groups or different users.

2. Horizontal access control would check if a user or an object is allowed to access the details of that account or that object, and in this case, this control allows things like users to see their own account details, but not the details of other users. So, horizontal access control in this case

3. Context-dependent access control checks for things like if a user is allowed to do something based on the state of the application, for example, adding an item to a basket before the release date or when the stock is zero
